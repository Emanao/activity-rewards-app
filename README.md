#Activity Rewards App
The Activity Rewards App is a rails web application that allows users track points for specific activities, which an administrator have assigned before. Some further statistical admin functionality is provided.
All users are required to have either a local or remote account (GitHub in my case) for authentication purposes. Once they are authenticated they access to their profile page. The profile page differs from the user role. When admin users access to their profile page they can add goals to existing users or edit existing goals. Admins can also search users by name and they have an overview of some user statistics in their profile page. Regular users profile page offers the possibility to update their achieved goals and see the total balance in their points account.

## Getting Started
